# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Initialization failure now reports specific disconnected joints (e.g. `finger(2).joint(1)`) instead of generic error message

### Added

- **Zenoh Bridge (Python)**: standalone bridge process exposing WujiHand via Zenoh network protocol (`bridge/python/hand_zenoh_bridge.py`)
- **Zenoh Bridge (C++)**: native C++ bridge with lower latency for production deployment (`bridge/cpp/`)
- 16 Zenoh resources: 12 GET (scalar + 5×4 joint arrays), 5 SET (target_position, control_mode, enabled, effort_limit, reset_error)
- 2 SUB publishers (actual_position + actual_effort) with configurable `--pub-rate` (no default, must be explicitly set)
- Host-side UTC microsecond timestamps in `{timestamp_us, data}` envelope format for all SUB data
- `@capability` queryable with full JSON schema (SUB resources include timestamp envelope schema)
- `@control` acquire/release protocol with liveliness-based TTL for automatic crash recovery
- Realtime controller integration: target_position writes via atomic update → PDO 1kHz
- Python/C++ fire-and-forget target_position subscriber for low-latency PUT writes
- 37 unit tests for bridge protocol, resources, timestamps, and control ownership
- `bridge/README.md` with architecture, usage, and resource documentation

## [1.5.1] - 2026-02-02

### Added

- `Hand.disable_thread_safe_check()` API for multi-threaded usage
- Example: `5.multithread.py` demonstrating multi-threaded PDO operations

## [1.5.0] - 2026-01-19

### Added

- Real-time `joint_effort` reading via `IController.get_joint_actual_effort()`
- `joint_effort_limit` now supports read operations (previously write-only)
- Example: add `read_joint_effort_limit()` demo in `1.read.py`

### Changed

- Effort values use Ampere (A) units externally, with automatic mA conversion for firmware
- Renamed `current_limit` to `effort_limit` across all APIs

### Deprecated

- `current_limit` API - use `effort_limit` instead

## [1.4.0] - 2025-12-19

### Added

- Serial number (SN) reading from device via `read_product_sn()`
- Automatic exception detection with remediation hints based on TPDO error codes

### Fixed

- C++11 compatibility for header files
- Version parsing for release candidate (rc) versions

### Changed

- Refactored examples for improved clarity
- Enhanced README with bilingual support (English/Chinese)

## [1.3.0] - 2025-12-05

### Added

- Firmware-side real-time filtering support
- Full system firmware version reporting
- Automatic SDK/firmware version logging during initialization
- Protocol-level latency testing

### Changed

- Unified version naming: `hardware_version/date` → `firmware_version/date`
- C++ `Hand::realtime_controller` now returns `std::unique_ptr<IController>` with filter support

### Removed

- `attach_realtime_controller()` and `detach_realtime_controller()` (C++ API only)

## [1.2.0] - 2025-11-07

### Added

- Interface timeout configuration (default 0.5s)
- Logging system

### Changed

- New `realtime_controller()` interface with built-in low-pass filter
  - Automatically switches to real-time control mode on enter
  - Restores Point-to-Point mode on exit
  - Enables stable 1kHz control with low-frequency (~20-100 Hz) input
- Optimized joint data naming:
  - `joint_control_word` → `joint_enabled`
  - `joint_position` → `joint_actual_position`
  - `joint_control_position` → `joint_target_position`
- Removed mandatory NumPy type requirement for input parameters

### Deprecated

- `pdo_write_unchecked()` - use `realtime_controller()` instead

### Compatibility

- Requires firmware v3.0.0+
